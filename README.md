# React Online Book Library

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/frameworks)

This project is an online book library that lets you save all your favourite books in one place. You can add new books, delete old books and toggle books as complete/incomplete. The website will automatically save your favourite book preferences using your computers `localStorage`.

The website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). The website was a rebuild of an [earlier project](https://github.com/timkellytk/project-library) within The Odin Project.
